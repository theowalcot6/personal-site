            <h6 class='hi'>Hi, I'm Theo!</h6>
            <p class='aboutme'>I'm a Senior Product Manager at E.ON Next on the Retention team, leading the strategy and focussing on shipping high value features across our Web and App. I graduated from The University of Bristol in 2017 where I majored in Mathematics with a focus on practical Artificial Intelligence. I'm from Teddington, London where I grew up spending almost all my time playing football. From 6 to 16 years old, I played for Brentford Football Academy before going on to play for my 1st XI team at University. At University, I studied a range of complex courses focussing on emerging technology. I studied several Deep Learning Neural Network architectures including CNNs, GANs and Transformers as well the application of Advanced Reinforcement Learning methods. This sparked an interest in new technologies that I haven't been able to shake going into my career. Nowadays, I spend my time between my work where I focus on shipping products fast and my hobbies which is pretty much anything technology or football related. At work, I have a particular focus on features that have an AI or data element to deliver value to our customers. I also work on data science and machine learning projects as my side hustle and so I never stop learning what's out there, which I've been doing for almost 8 years now.</p>
            <p class='aboutme'>Other than that, I enjoy other creative outlets such as getting my hands dirty with paint and clay for arts and crafts, taking photos, playing songs I love on the piano, or getting bruises from learning skateboard tricks. I love outdoor activities such as snowboarding, hiking, and beach volleyball</p>
